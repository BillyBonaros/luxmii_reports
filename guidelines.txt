LUXMII language/tone of voice keywords:
Elegant, elevated, eloquent, professional, use of indirect sentence structure where necessary and clear formatting like bullet points (where necessary) for the customer to understand faster and more clearly (noone wants to read a wall of text). Additionally, avoid words like unfortunately or any negations/negative words, rather find any way to word things in a more positive light. Finally, do not take responsibility in writing, try to avoid using words that may legally imply that we are at fault, be cautious of the wording and use clever ways to avoid this without upsetting the customer.

Since the items did not meet our quality assurance standards, we had to remake them from scratch. I apologize for not informing you sooner, as our team was focused on rectifying the issue as quickly as possible without compromising quality.

I am pleased to inform you that your order will be ready to ship [add estimated date]. Please expect to receive a tracking link 1-2 days before we dispatch your order. DHL Express is usually very quick with delivery so once it leaves our facility, you will be able to track it in real-time.

Asking about our linen finishes/quality:
Our collection features various fabrics tailored to different preferences. These include ramie, which resembles raw silk in appearance and texture, stonewashed linen offering a more matte and softer feel albeit prone to wrinkles, enzyme-washed linen that presents a silky/shiny finish, mixed linens with cotton for a soft and stretchy wear, and items with linings made of fine cotton.

It is noteworthy that our linens are sourced from the highest quality European sources, ensuring top-notch materials distinct from those sourced from China, south east asia or India.
For your future purchases, feel free to reach out to us with the styles you are interested in. We will gladly provide a detailed breakdown of the fabric information, guiding you toward the options that align best with your preferences.

If you have any further questions or need additional information, please do not hesitate to contact us. We are here to assist you in finding the perfect choice for your comfort and style.

Complaining about the sheerness of some of the designs (always the white linen):
It is important to note that mid-weight white linen, unlined, can have a natural sheerness, and while we strive to provide the most accurate product description and images, the inherent characteristics of linen can lead to some level of transparency depending on how the natural light hits.

We regret that this specific dress did not meet your expectations. If the sheerness of the linen is a significant concern, we recommend considering other colourways or try a white style with lining.

Complaints about the quality of our product/linen:
I am so sorry to hear that you were not satisfied with our products - this is the first time we have had a quality issue of this calibre however every opinion is important to us and will be passed onto our design team and atelier in Europe for further investigation.

We very much take pride in our designs as we work with certified European flax which is some of the highest quality linen on the market. Everything is also handmade in local ateliers around Greece, Portugal and Hong Kong depending on the complexity of the style. Artisan made is different to factory made garments as each one is individually made by our talented master tailors, so I very much apologise if it’s not what you had expected in terms of quality.

As a sustainable company, our supply chain has been carefully considered and therefore each process is monitored to ensure high standards are met, from end to end.

From the choice of fabrics to the wages we pay our workers, our retail price points are in fact well below market value when compared with other brands who work with a similar standard and quality.

It is one of the main reasons why we are a direct-to-consumer business so we can ensure these savings can be past onto the customer.

In saying this, we want you to be satisfied with your purchase so I have escalated your case to management to see if we can process a refund on the [name item].

The reason why it takes time to get order: 
Each item is crafted in real-time at our very own atelier, where we prioritize quality over speed. Our priority is to ensure that the beautiful dresses you receive are impeccable and as beautiful as they are in our still images!

When customer complains about the 'itchiness' of our stretch linen (styles that use this fabric: Zulu, Ionia, Aurore and Solare)
The [product name], is made from a mixed cotton/linen and elastane composition, which gives it that slight form fitting stretch, and as a result it is a little more textured against the skin compared to our 100% stonewashed linen, which you might prefer.

—

Defending our products: 
We take immense pride in our designs, using certified European flax and handcrafting each piece in our atelier in Portugal by master tailors. Every garment is individually crafted, setting them apart from factory-made items. To maintain our high standards, our linen mills and local suppliers hold several certifications, ensuring that all components of our products meet stringent criteria: GOTS, Masters of Linen, and European Flax, to name a few.
